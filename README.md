Filter Stash
============

Simplify the usage of the block [Stash](https://moodle.org/plugins/block_stash) by providing shortcodes to place items.

Why using this?
---------------

With this filter the snippet to place the items becomes very simple:

    [drop:123:abc]

# Teachers do not have to switch to the HTML view of their editors
# The shortcode is always visible when editing, unlike the Javascript snippet
# Unlike the Javascript snippet, the shortcode will gracefully support newer versions
# The snippet will (safely) make it through some security limitations

Requirements
------------

Moodle 2.9 or greater.

Installation
------------

Simply install the plugin and enable the filter.
